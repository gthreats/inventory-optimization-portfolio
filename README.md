# Inventory Optimization Portfolio  
**Lead Analyst Perspective – Enterprise Supply Chain**

## Purpose of This Portfolio
This portfolio demonstrates how I approach inventory optimization at an enterprise level, with a focus on translating statistical analysis into practical inventory policies, system parameters, and executive-level decisions. The work here reflects how I would operate as a Lead Inventory Optimization Analyst, balancing service levels, working capital, and risk through disciplined, cross-functional alignment.

Rather than treating inventory optimization as a purely mathematical exercise, this portfolio shows how inventory decisions are shaped by demand variability, lead-time risk, system constraints, and organizational alignment across supply planning, operations, procurement, and finance.

## Inventory Optimization Philosophy
I do not view service level, working capital, risk reduction, and cross-functional alignment as competing priorities. In practice, cross-functional alignment is the foundation that enables the other three to be optimized in a sustainable way.

From experience in high-volume distribution and supply chain operations, service level targets only hold when demand planning, procurement, operations, and finance are aligned on assumptions, constraints, and trade-offs. When alignment breaks down, inventory decisions become reactive, driving excess working capital through overstocking or increasing risk through stockouts and expedited freight.

Working capital efficiency and risk reduction are outcomes of disciplined, aligned decision-making. When teams share a common understanding of demand variability, lead-time uncertainty, and service commitments, inventory parameters such as safety stock, reorder points, lot sizes, and SKU segmentation can be tuned intentionally rather than defensively. This alignment also enables faster course correction in environments affected by seasonality, promotions, or supplier volatility.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates
This repository is organized to mirror how inventory optimization work is structured in an enterprise environment, from strategy and policy through execution and performance monitoring.

### 00_executive_overview
High-level inventory strategy, operating principles, and executive-facing summaries that frame how inventory decisions support customer service, financial performance, and risk management.

### 01_safety_stock_optimization
Statistical analysis of demand and lead-time variability, service level trade-offs, and safety stock parameter setting. Demonstrates how analytical outputs translate into inventory policy decisions.

### 02_lot_size_optimization
Lot sizing and replenishment logic, including EOQ, MOQ constraints, and cost trade-offs. Focuses on balancing inventory efficiency with operational and transportation realities.

### 03_sap_inventory_parameters
Conceptual mapping of inventory optimization decisions to SAP ECC / APO master data and planning parameters. Demonstrates configuration literacy and governance, not just analytical output.

### 04_multi_echelon_inventory
Multi-echelon inventory network thinking, including risk pooling, inventory positioning, and service level propagation across distribution networks.

### 05_inventory_policy_kpis
Inventory governance frameworks, KPI definitions, and performance monitoring standards used to track service, working capital, and inventory health over time.

### 06_executive_presentations
Executive-level presentations that translate analysis into clear decisions, trade-offs, and recommendations suitable for senior leadership.
