# Safety Stock & Reorder Point Optimization

This section demonstrates a structured, enterprise-ready approach to setting safety stock and reorder point parameters based on demand variability, lead-time uncertainty, and service-level policy.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Per-day demand modeling aligned to lead time
- Combined demand and lead-time variance
- Service level to Z-score translation using standardized policy tiers
- Safety stock and reorder point calculation
- Service-level tradeoff analysis and working capital impact

## Artifacts
- **Safety_Stock_and_ROP_Optimization.xlsx**  
  Excel-based model showing Inputs → Calculations → Outputs, including a scenario comparison of 95% vs 99% service levels for representative SKUs.

## Business Relevance
This model reflects how inventory parameters would be defined, validated, and governed in an enterprise planning environment, with outputs suitable for review by Supply Planning, Operations, and Finance leadership.
